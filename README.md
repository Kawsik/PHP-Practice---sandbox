PHP-Practice---sandbox
======================

From TutsPlus - PHP Fundamentals , I am learning some PHP . And some of my created files are here.


# Welcome to the PHP-Practice---sandbox wiki!

I wanted to learn PHP. It's a few weeks I am learning PHP. At my practicing PHP I created some files that. And I thought that my practicing files could be valuable to others.

    So how can I make them visible to others ? > The ans is GitHub.
    But can I represent those more attractively ? > And the ans is the Pages of GitHub.

Here I just presenting my php practicing files.

Thank you for visiting me.
